                        <strong>Abstract: </strong>In the age of big data, SMP architecture system is unable to deal with the pressure and challenges caused by the explosive growth of data. With development of network technology, the miniaturization of PC server and the mature of Linux system, database technology based on MPP architecture becomes the first choice in big data applications for different users of various industries. Through the technology of distributed parallel computing and dynamic expansion, known as NewSQL, MPP architecture has the capability to support massive data processing, database warehouse and other application scenarios, meet the business requirements of telecom and financial industry, improve the service support capability, and realize low cost, large capacity, high performance and flexibility.
As the leader of China’s database industry,  GBASE is the first vendor to develop MPP technology and product. GBASE has rich experience in database technology and application, the capability of helping build the business platforms and improve the system support capability for the industries of telecom, finance, security and government etc. The core product in MPP technology field of GBASE is GBase 8a MPP Cluster, used for big-data analysis functions. With the technology of massively parallel processing, column storage, adaptive compression and smart index, GBase 8a MPP Cluster can keep pace with international mainstream technologies, and bring the values of improving performance, lowering IT investment cost and clouding new systems etc.
