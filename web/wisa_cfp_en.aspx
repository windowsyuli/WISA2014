        <p>Internet and Web have brought the deep effects on our society and made Web information system one of the main popular distributed application systems which takes a more and more important role in information systems of various organizations and enterprises. WISA is an annual national conference on Web Information Systems and Applications (WISA) sponsored by the Electronic Government and Office Automation Society of China Computer Federation. The previous 9 WISA conferences were held in Wuhan (2004), Shenyang (2005), Nanjing (2006), Beijing (2007), Xi’an (2008) and Xuzhou (2009), Huhhot (2010), Chongqing(2011), Haikou(2012) ,Yangzhou(2013).
        </p>
        <p>
        WISA2014 will continue this good tradition of providing opportunities for extensive discussions and information exchange on core technique in Web information systems, application framework and architecture in Web information systems, Web information system applications, and so on. Two workshops will be held in conjunction with the main conference: the 9th Workshop on Semantic Web(SWON 2014) and Ontology as well as the 8th Workshop on Electronic Government Technique and Application(EGTA 2014). 

Conference content will be submitted for inclusion into IEEE Xplore as well as other Abstracting and Indexing (A&I) databases. Selected English papers will be published in a special issue of "Frontiers of Computer Science in China" (FCS, Published by Springer, SCI indexed). Accepted papers in Chinese will be published in the the formal core journals of "Mini and Micro Computer systems" and "Computer and Digital Engineering". In addition to the paper presentations, a few well-known experts will be invited to give keynotes in the conference. Awards will be offered to the outstanding papers by students in the conference.
